# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a model to predict a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on Multidimensionsal 
Voice Program (MDVP) recordings.  PD diagnosis is currently based on two of four clinical observations of an individual along with family history.  These four 
clinical observations include:
* slowness of movement
* shaking or tremor
* stiffness or rigidity of the arms, legs, or trunk, and 
* trouble with balance and/or falling
It may be possible to include voice recordings when diagnosing PD to support a positive diagnosis.  Sometimes PD can take time to diagnosis in order for symptoms to 
progress to a point that are clearly indicative of PD.  This project looks at the potential to include a voice recording in the diagnosing process. 

## Data

This data was collected my Max Little at the University of Oxford and is housed in the **UCI** Machine Learning Repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons. This data set contains MDVP measurements  on various voice measurements and whether Parkinsons 
Disease was diagnosed. There are 31 people in the study with, 23 of whom were diagnosed with PD, and there are 195 total voice recordings.
